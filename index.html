        <h2>Brief Intro:</h2>
       <p>
         As a musician, restuarant worker, customer service rep, and person, my
         goals in my work remain aligned: creating environments and works which 
         meet the needs and wants of the people around me. Though I am new to development and coding,
         I am the furthest from a stranger to collabortaion, hard work, and understanding the needs of my peers.
